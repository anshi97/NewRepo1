/*
 * The above code fragment shows a procedure that modifies a linked list.
 * If it is required to view every single element of the linked list,
 * this can best be achieved using the typedef expansion technique
 * which recurses up and down structures and similar types to completely
 * expand all paths until all the possible routes end in null.
 * The values for all he elements of the linked list will then be
 * reported upon.
 */

/*
 * Creating a test case for the procedure causes 2 variables to be
 * populated in the IO view.
 * These are an input and output variables for the parameter big.
 * The input parameter should be assigned the address of global bl1.
 * We know that bl1 is a linked list. We wish to determine all the
 * values stored in the linked list. This can be achieved by selecting
 * the output variable in the IO view and selecting the Set as Typedef
 * Expansion option. Ensure the variable is not suspended. The value
 * field for the variable is a marker or comment indicating the operation.
 *
 * Running and accepting the test case adds an additional 9 variables
 * into the IO. These are the variables that have been found in the
 * linked list. Note only the pointer variables that equate to null are
 * shown. This is because non-null pointer addresses may change between
 * execution of test programs resulting inregression failure. Their
 * actual values are insignificant, but the members of this pointer
 * are displayed in full. Viewing the added variables in the IO view
 * it can be seen that not only is the structure pointed to by the
 * parameter expanded but also the pointer to structures found as
 * elements will also be expanded.
 * Care should be exercised using this facility. All pointer values
 * should be assigned to valid section of memory or set to null -
 * otherwise the results will be unpredicatable.
